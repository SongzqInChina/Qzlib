mapper["new_file.txt"] = "Sample content"

# Create a directory
mapper["new_directory"] = {}

# Attempting to access an invalid path raises an exception
# mapper["invalid_path"]

# Delete a file
del mapper["new_file.txt"]

# Get file attributes
file_info = mapper.get("existing_file.txt")
# Alternatively
file_info = mapper["existing_file.txt"]

# Scan the directory for files and subdirectories
mapper.scan()
# Access the scan results
scan_results = mapper.scan_results
